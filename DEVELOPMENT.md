# Development

## Basics

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/datadogpy.git


## Adding new API endpoints
This section outlines the process for adding a new endpoint to this API client.

Let's use the example of creating an endpoint for `Hosts`. This example endpoint accepts either a GET or DELETE request at the `/hosts` endpoint as well as a GET request at the `hosts/totals` endpoint.

**NOTE:** This endpoint is just an example and doesn't describe the existing `hosts` resource.

Start by adding a new file `hosts.py` to the `datadog/api` folder for the new endpoint. Use the following simple class structure:

```
from datadog.api.resources import (
    GetableAPIResource,
    DeletableAPIResource
)

class Hosts(GetableAPIResource, DeletableAPIResource):
    """
    A wrapper around Hosts HTTP API.
    """
    _resource_name = 'hosts'
```

Each class has the above simple structure, most importantly the following two pieces:

* A `_resource_name` - Indicates the URI of the api.
* A set of classes to inherit from. This is where the get/post/put/delete request code is defined for you. Available options are:

| Class Name         | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CreateableAPIResource | Wrapper class for providing a `POST` request for your class, implementing a `create` method.    |
| SendableAPIResource   | Fork of CreateableAPIResource class with a `send` method.                                       |
| UpdatableAPIResource  | Wrapper class for providing a `PUT` request for your class, implementing an `update` method.    |
| DeletableAPIResource  | Wrapper class for providing a `DELETE` request for your class, implementing an `delete` method. |
| GetableAPIResource    | Wrapper class for providing a `GET` request for your class, implementing an `get` method.       |
| ListableAPIResource   | Wrapper class for providing a `GET` request for your class, implementing an `get_all` method.   |
| SearchableAPIResource | Fork of ListableAPIResource class with a `_search` method.                                      |
| ActionAPIResource     | Generic wrapper to trigger any type of HTTP request.                                            |

More information about the available classes to inherit from can be found in the [`resources.py`](https://github.com/DataDog/datadogpy/blob/master/datadog/api/resources.py) file.

Looking back at the class above:

* The URI this class can access is defined: `hosts`.
* The `delete` and `get` methods can be called by inheriting `GetableAPIResource` and `DeletableAPIResource`.

The remaining piece is to add support for the `GET` request to the `hosts/totals` URI. To do this, update your code to include:

```
from datadog.api.resources import (
    GetableAPIResource,
    DeletableAPIResource,
    ActionAPIResource
)

class Hosts(GetableAPIResource, DeletableAPIResource, ActionAPIResource):
    """
    A wrapper around Hosts HTTP API.
    """
    _resource_name = 'hosts'
    @classmethod
    def totals(cls):
        """
        Get total number of hosts active and up.

        :returns: Dictionary representing the API's JSON response
        """
        return super(Hosts, cls)._trigger_class_action('GET', 'totals')
```

Notice the addition of the new inherited class `ActionAPIResource`, and the new function `totals`. This new `totals` function calls the `_trigger_class_action` method from that class and appends `totals` to our URI, making the full path: `baseAPI/hosts/totals`.

Now you can use your new SDK and call the following methods with various params and request bodies:
* `Hosts.totals()`
* `Hosts.get()`
* `Hosts.delete()`

### Tests

This project contains:
- [Datadog API Client](/datadog/api)
- [Dogshell](/datadog/dogshell)
- [DogStatsD](/datadog/dogstatsd)
- [Threadstats](/datadog/threadstats)


We have [unit](/tests/unit), [integration](/tests/integration) and [performance](/tests/performamce) tests.
Integration tests need an _API_ and _APP Keys_ to run against a Datadog account.
- __WARNING__: Never use keys for an organization that contains anything important.

We use `tox` to run tests. You can find the [tox.ini](/tox.ini) config in the root directory.
We create 2 environments:
- Default environments: they will run all Unit, Performance and Integration tests not marked as `admin_needed`.
  - Execute this with the `tox` command.
- The explicit `integration-admin` environment: It will only run integration tests marked with the `admin_needed` marker.
  - Tests marked as `admin-needed` need an API and APP Key with admin permissions. 
  - __!!!WARNING!!!__ These tests will use these keys to do destructive changes on your Datadog account. 
    - __Never use keys for an organization that contains anything important!__.

#### Setup Integration Tests

To setup integration tests you will need to export the following environment variables.

```
# !!!WARNING!!! The integration tests will use these keys to do destructive changes.
# Never use keys for an organization that contains anything important.
export DD_TEST_CLIENT_API_KEY=<api_key_for_a_testing_org>
export DD_TEST_CLIENT_APP_KEY=<app_key_for_a_testing_org>
export DD_TEST_CLIENT_USER=<user_handle_for_testing_comments_api>
```

#### Run tests

By default, when invoking `tox`, [unit](#unit-tests), [style](#style-checks) and [integration](#integration-tests) that don't require admin credentials will all be run.

##### Unit tests

Unit tests are run with all the `pyXX` environments.

For example, run the unit tests with Python 3.7 with:
```
tox -e py37
```

##### Style checks

Run flake8 validation with:
```
tox -e flake8
```

##### Integration tests

Integration tests run against an actual Datadog account. You need to [provide credentials](#setup-integration-tests) for them to run.
For this reason, it is **highly recommended** to avoid providing credentials for a production account.

There are two kinds of integration tests:
  - [Regular integration tests](#regular-integration-tests)
  - [Admin integration tests](#admin-integration-tests)

###### Regular integration tests

Regular integration tests are tests that can work with credentials from a standard Datadog user, without admin privileges.
They will create resources in Datadog such as dashboards or monitors, and clean up after themselves.

Run them with
```
tox -e integration
```

###### Admin integration tests

Admin integration tests are tests that either need admin privileges to run (e.g. manage users) or can destructive changes to your org (e.g. muting/unmuting of all monitors).
They are not run by default when invoking `tox`, you have to run them explicitely with:
```
tox -e integration-admin
```

##### Run specific tests methods/classes/folders

`tox` invokes `pytest` to run the tests. You can pass `pytest` arguments in the `tox` command line for further filtering of the tests you want to run.

For example, to exclude all integrations tests using the `--ignore-glob` argument.

```
tox -- --ignore-glob=tests/integration/*
```

Another example below shows how to run test classes or test methods matching a given string by using the `-k` argument from `pytest`. 
With this command, only run classes and methods matching `dogstatsd` are run.

```
tox -- -k dogstatsd
```

To run the entire `dogstatsd` folder, use:

```
tox -- tests/unit/dogstatsd
```
