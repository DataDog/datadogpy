# Releasing

This document summarizes the process of doing a new release of this project.
Release can only be performed by Datadog maintainers of this repository.

## Schedule
This project does not have a strict release schedule. However, we would make a release at least every 2 months.
  - No release will be done if no changes got merged to the `master` branch during the above mentioned window.
  - Releases may be done more frequently than the above mentioned window.

## Make Sure Everything Works

* Check and upgrade dependencies where it applies and makes sense. [Example](https://github.com/DataDog/datadogpy/commit/f81efe8cbf6e5bc5cb4ab46da750248161d0c548#diff-2eeaed663bd0d25b7e608891384b7298)
  - Create a distinct pull request and test your changes since it may introduce regressions.
  - While using the latest versions of dependencies is advised, it may not always be possible due to potential compatibility issues.
  - Upgraded dependencies should be thoroughly considered and tested to ensure they are safe!
* Make sure tests are passing.
  - Locally and in the continuous integration system.
* Make sure documentation is up-to-date and building correctly.
* Build the package locally (e.g. `python3 setup.py sdist`), install it into a fresh virtualenv and test the changes that have been made since the last release.
